Hey, I noticed you haven't responded yet. To save us both some time, I wanted to share a couple of things before we move forward. I currently live in Vasai, but my office is in Andheri, so I'm flexible with locations across Mumbai and Thane. Additionally, I've been dealing with hair loss for a few years and use a hair patch to manage it. I completely understand if this is a consideration for you, but if not, I'd love to continue our conversation. Feel free to cancel the invite if you're looking for something different.
